  ## Creating Templates
Creating a template is simple. Any `.docx` file can be used as a template. Simply add `{#loop}` to the beginning of your template, and `{/loop}` at the end of your template. Anywhere within the template that you want to use data from the `.csv` file, simply include the name of the data column you'd like to display between brackets in your template. So for example, to include the owner's full name in your template, add `{owner}` to the template where you would like it to appear. You can see examples of how to use the data in the template by checking out `envelope-template.docx` and `letter-template.docx`

### Full list of supported data columns
 - Owner -> `{owner}`
 - Mailing Address 1 -> `{mailingAddress1}`
 - Mailing Address 3 -> `{mailingAddress3}`
  

  ## Usage
  Once all the dependencies are installed, the project is ready to use. Inside the project directory, save your desired .csv file with the name `seller-data.csv`. Save your template for the letters with the name `letter-template.docx`. Save your template for the envelopes with the name `envelope-template.docx`.

  After ensuring you've saved your files with the correct names in the correct directory, use the terminal to execute the following command `npm start`.

  If everything is successful, you should see a message in the terminal, and there should be a newly created file, named `generated-seller-letters.docx` in the project directory.
