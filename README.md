  ## Installation
  After downloading the project to your local system, use the terminal to navigate to the directory where the project is saved. Execute the following command `npm i` in order to install all the required dependencies for the project.
  ## Usage
  Once all the dependencies are installed, the project is ready to use. Inside the project directory, save your desired .csv file with the name `seller-data.csv`. After ensuring you've saved your .csv file with the correct name in the correct directory, use the terminal to execute the following command `npm start`. If everything is successful, you should see a message in the terminal, and there should be a newly created file, named `generated-seller-letters.docx` in the project directory.
