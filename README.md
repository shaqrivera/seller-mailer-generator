  ## Usage
  Once all the dependencies are installed, the project is ready to use. Inside the project directory, save your desired .csv file with the name `seller-data.csv`. Save your template for the letters with the name `letter-template.docx`. Save your template for the envelopes with the name `envelope-template.docx`.
